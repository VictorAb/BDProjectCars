Sales Forecast Regression Exercise

Each data file must have a matrix called ProjectData. This matrix has as many rows as observations and as many columns as variables. 

For example, the default file used e.g. by RunStudy.R (file SALES) has 40 observations and 9 variables which are: "PDI", "DEALS", "PRICE", "R.D", "INVEST", "ADVERTIS", "EXPENSE", "TOTINDAD", "SALES"
